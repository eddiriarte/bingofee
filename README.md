# bingofee

Bingofee is an analogy to the german word "Lottofee", that represents the person(ususally a woman) which picks the lottery numbers from the machine in a very gracious way.

The application will pick random numbers and read the aloud(in german), so every player can focus on their bingo sheets. Currently only tested with Google Chrome.

This was a ten minute project I built to for a bingo night with my family. On the first round I discovered we were missing lots of pull-numbers from our board, so I lost miserably.
